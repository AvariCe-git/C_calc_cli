Simple calculation between two numbers in command line

This "program" is a really simple two number calculator.
It can do addition, subraction, multiplication, division
modulo operation, raise a number the nth power and find 
the nth root of a number. It accepts 3 arguments from the 
command line, when it is called. The first number, the 
option and the second number, in that order with spaces between them. 
For help, th arguments should be h and 1.
The options are: + for addition, - for subtraction, x for multiplication, / for division
% for modulo, ^ for exponentation and r for finding the root of a number, h for help. 
for subtraction, the first mumber is the minuend and the second is the subtrahend. ex: whatever.exe 1st - 2nd 
for division, the first number is the dividend and the second is the divisor. ex: whatever.exe 1st / 2nd
For modulo, the first number is the dividend and the second is the divisor. ex: whatever.exe 1st % 2nd
For exponentation, the first number is the base and the second is the exponent. ex: whatever.exe 1st ^ 2nd
For any root, the first number is the radicand and the second is the degree. ex: whatever.exe 1st r 2nd
